## **1. Project Overview**
    
    The script consits in a system that enhance catalogation process for vinyl stores and collectors. Anyone can access by creating a profile on the website. After you create your profile and choose a username and password, you will be asked to choose one of the three categories, (*store owner*, *collector* or *volunter*) - the volunter provides help for  collectors, but especialy for store owners to catalogue their vinyl collection, helping them selling their products online.

----
## **2. Features**
> 1. Provides help to music store owners;
> 2. Connect music enthusiasts, vinyl collectors and music stores;
> 3. It´s symple to acces and use.
----
## **Installation & Requirements**
    
    It is required access to an internet signal and an web browser.

----
## **Possible Issues / Limitations**
    
    Because the system rellies on peoples *good faith* and their will to help each other, bad situations such as scams should be expected. Of course It's needed to provide personal information when creating an account, for safety purposes. Securing users is the main goal after the system is full opperational.

# **Answer the questions**

Question: *What’s the difference between a database and a spreadsheet?*
> Answer: A database It's a complete data storage system that can be programmed for user experience and relate with other programing languages, like Python, Java or PhP.

Question: *Why is Python so popular for beginners?*
> Answer: Python Is the popular language In general- because It is a complete language that can be used for almost every application using Python's API's. It have a very simple syntax beeing considered a accesible programming language, that's why It's popular betwen begginer to - It is easy to learn and use.

Question: *What are the advantages of using version control systems like Git?*
> Answer: In my knowledge control systems like Git are very useful to store and share systems and applications betwen users, you can share It easely with yourself and open a project that you are working on in any machine.

Question: *How does data backup protect information?*
> Answer: By creating a copy of It...

Question: *What’s the role of logic in programming?*
> Answer: It's basic to uderstand any language and algorithym applications.

Question: *What is the difference between frontend and backend?*
> Answer: Front-end reffers to a system development area that deals with the visual steps of a program or system. HTML and JavaScript are both programming languages used in front-end. Back-end it's the coding and database of a system It don't deals with any visual aspect of a program or a system.

# **Extra Challenge**
    From every thing I read on the internet when searching for tips and opinions about coding and system development before making the decision to start this course, I can advise a begginner to serach about other people opinions that work and study in the area. Some will say to you that A.I. will destroy this everything or that you doesn't need to get started in a course to learn coding. What I can say is that programming Isn't easy and you will need to study and practice a lot, maybe you can do it by yourself or not, but you will have to anyway. It's a broad area with a lot of contents to understand and practice, aldow It isn't extremely hard as some people might say. I find it very fun and useful and It's interesting to understand it because everything and everyone uses some kind of software or app nowadays and the tech It's getting more elaborated and inteligent as the days go on.

# **Writing a Comparative Tech Review**
>## Comparing Java vs Python
> >When starting my journey in System Devolpment at Senac, the first coding language that I learned were Java. Java is an old, but still openly used coding language- It is indeed the oldest language that still is used in labs and business for comercial purposes. Being an old language It is a little bit more complex, in another way it's very complete in terms that what can you do just using It. Python in another way its' newer but you need APIs to create other process that Java can do by itself. Java is a complete coding language that you need to do every step in order to use It, for example - You need to insert every library that you will need in your system, and you need to start all you variables in the begginig of the program. You can see by that, that Java It's an extense language with a lot of text.
>
> >Python It's a newer language and openly used by professionals and students. It is simplier than Java with lot of text abreviations and with no need to start a variabel or isert libraries, but in another way you will have to use a wide range of a APIs to create the system you want to. Python it's a famous language between programing courses and learning institutions that teach coding for all that reasons.

# **Writing a Professional Technical Email**
>## Email to a Project Mannager
> >Greatings Mr. Mannager.
>
>>I got knowledge about the team decision to use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL as the new internal tool for our business institution. I suppose that the decision were made because SQLite had better performance results when tested by our team along this month.
>
>>We all agreed that It's the best decision in order to maintain our business efficience and excelent results.
>
>>Attached to this e-mail It's a resume of all the tests we provide using SQLite and I'd be happy to provide further details or even schedule a meeting.

>>Sincerly.
