### "Encryption" - According to Microsoft Copilot

```
Encryption is a method used to protect information by transforming it into a format that can only be read by someone who has the correct decryption key. Here’s a simple breakdown:

Encryption ensures that even if someone intercepts the data, they won’t be able to understand it without the decryption key. It’s widely used in various applications, such as securing online transactions, protecting personal data, and ensuring the confidentiality of communications.

```

```
Tradução:

Encriptamento é um método usado para proteger informações, transformando-as em um formato que só pode ser lido por quem tem a chave (senha) correta.

O encriptamento garante que, mesmo que alguém intercepte os dados, não irá conseguir entende-los sem uma chave de acesso. Este método é usado em várias aplicações, como segurança de transações online, proteção de dados pessoais e garantindo a confidencialidade de comunicação.
